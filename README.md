The Daily Bruin's print archive.

Note: this project is NOT future-proofed and needs to be updated annually (preferrably don't wait until April like me 😚✌️). At the beginning of each year, go through the index.html and script.js files, search for comments starting with "UPDATE:", and make changes accordingly.
