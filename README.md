Note: this project is NOT future-proofed and needs to be updated annually (preferrably don't wait until April like me 😚✌️). At the beginning of each year, go through the index.html and script.js files, search for comments starting with "UPDATE:", and make changes accordingly.

## Deployment
1. Update the code to include the new year's papers (remember to also increment all maximum ids by 1, check previous commits)
2. Check netlify to see if the website is deployed successfully
